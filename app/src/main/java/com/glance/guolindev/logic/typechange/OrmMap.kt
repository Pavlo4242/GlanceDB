 * This is the interface to map the object field types to database column types. The purpose of this

 * mapping work for one type and each subclass will do their own logic to finish the mapping job.
 *
 * The mapping rule should follow the SQLite3 data types definition in this link:
 * https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
